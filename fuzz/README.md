# Fuzzing Wickra Time Machine

[`cargo-fuzz`](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html) harnesses for the parsing and stateful entry points of Wickra Time Machine. Fuzzing requires a nightly Rust toolchain; CI runs every target for 30 seconds on the family's pinned `nightly-2026-07-01`.

## Setup

```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-07-01
```

The date is the family's fuzz nightly, pinned in `ci.yml`: a rolling `nightly`
regressed with a codegen ICE unrelated to this code, so every repository moves
the date together, on purpose.

## Targets

| Target | What it exercises |
| --- | --- |
| `spec_parse` | Parsing an arbitrary timeline spec must never panic — only return `Ok`/`Err`. |
| `event_fold` | Parsing an arbitrary JSONL recorded feed must never panic. |
| `seek` | Loading an arbitrary feed and seeking to an arbitrary timestamp must never panic (f64 overflow, huge ts, empty feed are all handled). |
| `command_json` | Driving the JSON command surface with arbitrary input must never panic; every failure comes back as an `Err` or an in-band `{"ok":false,...}` response. |

## Run

```bash
# From the repository root:
cargo +nightly-2026-07-01 fuzz run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu spec_parse
cargo +nightly-2026-07-01 fuzz run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu event_fold
cargo +nightly-2026-07-01 fuzz run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu seek
cargo +nightly-2026-07-01 fuzz run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu command_json
```

Each run continues until a crash is found or it is interrupted. A short
time-boxed smoke run is what CI does:

```bash
cargo +nightly-2026-07-01 fuzz run --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu spec_parse -- -max_total_time=30
```

The expectation for every target is that it never panics: malformed or
adversarial input must surface as an `Err` or an in-band error, never a crash.
